      Happy quarantine! I hope we are all doing well! Today I want to talk about the phrase as old as time:
      Don't judge a book by it's cover. In other words, don't judge others or make assumptions about somebody
      before you get to know them. Don't get me wrong, I belive that this is a very meaningful phrase to live
      by, I just feel that we need to look at it with a differnet set of eyes. Normally when we think of this 
      phrase we will think of a scary person who has a sad backstory that nobody knows about or the lonley kid at
      school who has no friends but is a really good person on the inside. While these are good examples of when this
      phrase could be used, I feel like these are the only examples ever used. I want to share some other types of 
      examples from my life that never seem to be used to talk about this phrase.
      <br>
      <br>
      But know for a more interesting example. Another person I know is what many would call "the teacher's pet". But
      what most do not know is how this person is much different around friends that they are "out in public". For example,
      when around friends, they will talk about how they really feel about others (no matter how rude it is). Now don't get
      me wrong, I don't stand for talking behind people's backs, however, it is ok to disscuss how you feel about others once
      in a while. Nevertheless, this person is still very kind.
      <br>
      <br>
      The lesson of this story was that not all people are the way you see them. They may be different than they are in
      public, sometimes for the better or worse, depending on how you look at it. Maybe if we all stop judging people by how
      they act in public, maybe, just maybe, the world will be a better place.
