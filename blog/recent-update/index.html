      <div style="width:75%">
        Hello everyone. Recently there have been some strange occurences and
        incidents on our discord server.
        <br />
        At about 6:00pm last Tuesday, an unamed member of the Riverside Rocks
        discord server unbanned a troll. This unamed user then gave an invite
        link to the troll. The pair procceded to ban random users and remove and
        add ranks. At about 9:00pm, both users were banned from the server, but
        a large ammount of damage was already done.
        <br />
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/c6e2fb68-b6fa-497a-8990-4961d0f7a112%2FScreenshot%202020-04-02%20at%205.11.50%20PM.png?v=1585861925798"
        />
        <br />
        The troll is now banned from the server forever and the admin who worked
        with the troll is currently suspended for an indefinate ammount of time.
        If your account was banned from the server please send us an email or
        message me on Discord.
        <br />
        <br />
        Now, some of you may be asking, who was this troll, and how did he work
        with an admin to get back? This "troll" was somebody who I talk to
        sometimes, online and in person. We had been unfortunetly fighting
        latley and they joined the server to get back at me. This is not to say
        that I did things I should not have done during the period of fighting.
        We both made mistakes that we both regret. Earlier today we both made up
        and agree to not talk to each other for 14 days to reduce the risk of
        more tension.
        <br />
        <br />
        The admin who helped the troll is one of my friends who decided to work
        with the troll. I will be talking with them about what happened and what
        steps we can take moving forward.
        <br />
        <br />
        Please do me a favor and do not contact or bother the people involved in
        this, I have already planned to, if not already, talk to the people involved.
        <br />
        <br />
        Readers, please take this as a lesson not to succumb to fights - in the
        end, nobody will win. Stay kind during this hard time.
        <br />
        <br />
